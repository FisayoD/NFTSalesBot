# NFTsalesbot
A discord bot that tracks sales of Solana NFTs

First of all install dependencies:
<br>
$npm init
<br>
$npm install

To run this project, if you are using Mac/Replit:
<br>
Delete the first line of code in index.js 
<br>
Ensure you are in the correct file directory, else you can simply run $cd folder_name 
<br>
NEXT(do this in your terminal), $PROJECT_ADDRESS=9a...b DISCORD_URL=paste-url-here node index.js
<br>
<br>

For windows users: Don't delete the first line of code in your index.js 
<br>
Ensure you are in the correct file directory, else you can simply run $cd folder_name 
<br>
NEXT, create a file and name it .env, paste PROJECT_ADDRESS=9a...b on the first line and DISCORD_URL=paste-url-here on the second line 
<br>
Don't forget to put your .env in a .gitignore file so your discord webhook url is not publicly available
<br>
FINALLY(do this in your terminal), $node index.js
<br>
Voila!
